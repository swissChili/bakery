### Bash-based build tool

### Why is it useful?
Bash! its great, we all love it, and now you can more easily use it for building things.

Oh, and you dont need to have a bunch of `build.sh`, `install.sh`, `link.sh` scripts. all in one file!


### Roadmap
- make it actually useful by adding Bakers, background processes used to run things over SSH or other server things
